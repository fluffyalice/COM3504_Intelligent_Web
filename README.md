## How to use

It is a system used to help a unit of secret agents that can be used to share relevant information about a specific mission and its context. The site allows users to anonymously upload stories (pictures and their descriptions) and create rooms based on them. Except for uploading photographs, all discussion and annotation history will be maintained locally in this system, and the server will not record any of the data. Users may also utilise the system without an internet connection to access the history.
